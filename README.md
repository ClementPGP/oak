Rust.peg
========

Declare &amp; Use a grammar directly in your code.

My goals are:

* Assisted AST generation by typing the rules.
* Generate only code that doesn't compile to errors.
* Composability between different grammars.

This library is highly experimental, I don't even know if my goals are possible.
