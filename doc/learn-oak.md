This section is devoted to introduce smoothly the different PEG combinators through a tutorial presenting `Calc`: a small language with arithmetic expressions and variable bindings. If you want to test the code while reading this tutorial, a skeleton project is available in the section [Getting Started](getting-started.md). Before diving into the details, we present a program written in `Calc`:

```
let a = -10 - 2 in
let b = a / 2 in
a + 3 * (b / 2)
```

It declares two local variables `a` and `b` initialized with arithmetic expressions and usable within the scope of the let-binding, which is everything after the `in`. Let-bindings can be composed in cascade but must terminates with an arithmetic expression, such as `a + 3 * (b / 2)` in our example.

### What is parsing?

A parser is a bridge between meaning-less sequence of characters and structured representation of data. It tries to give meanings to raw characters by constructing an *Abstract Syntax Tree* (AST) that will be processed by subsequent compilation phases. We expect a parser to transform `7 - 1` into a structure such as `Minus(i32, i32)`. As a side note, you should avoid to compute the actual result of `7 - 1` in the parsing step, it works for simple language but tends to entangle syntactic and semantic analysis later. Invalid programs such as `let a = 8 in a * b` will still be correctly parsed, the semantic analysis is responsible for detecting that `b` is undeclared.

This tutorial will not cover the semantic analysis part and will only describe the grammar used for parsing `Calc`. Our parser will thus produce an AST and will not evaluate expressions.

### Syntactic atoms of `Calc`

When it comes to elaborate a grammar, we usually start by identifying atoms of the language, e.g. syntactic constructions that can not be divided into smaller ones. These atoms are called *tokens* and are often processed during a *lexical analysis* happening before the parsing. Oak is based on _Parsing Expression Grammar_ (PEG) and works directly on a stream of characters instead of a stream of tokens. An advantage is to have a unique and coherent grammar syntax which is helpful for composing grammars that do not necessarily expect the same set of tokens. Before continuing reading, try to find out what are the atoms of `Calc`.

The keywords `let` and `in`, the binding operator `=`, parenthesis `()` and arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` form the *unvalued atoms* of the language. `Calc` has two *valued atoms* which are identifiers and integers. Unvalued atoms give a shape to the AST but they do not carry any specific data inserted by the user. The following grammar parses the atoms of `Calc`:

```
grammar! calc {
  #![show_api]

  let_kw = "let"
  in_kw = "in"
  bind_op = "="
  add_op = "+"
  sub_op = "-"
  mul_op = "*"
  div_op = "/"

  identifier = ["a-zA-Z0-9_"]+
  integer = ["0-9"]+
}
```

A grammar is introduced with the macro `grammar! <name>` where `<name>` is the name of the grammar but also the name of the module in which generated functions will lie. A grammar is a set of rules of the form `<name> = <expr>` where `<name>` is the rule name and `<expr>` is a parsing expression. The rules describing keywords and operators use *string literals* expressions of the form `"<literal>"`, it expects the input to match exactly the sequence of characters given. Identifiers and integers are recognized with *character classes* where a class is a single character or a character range. A range `r` has the form `<char>-<char>` inside a set `["r1r2..rN"]`. Since `-` is used to denote a range, it must be placed before or after all the ranges such as in `["-a-z"]` to be recognized as an accepted character. Character classes will succeed and "eat" one character if it is present in the set, so `b`, `8`, `_` are all accepted by `["a-zA-Z0-9_"]` but `Ã©`, `-` or `]` are not. For both string literals and character classes, any Unicode characters are interpreted following the same requirements as [string literals](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#string-literals) in the Rust specification. The only other parsing expression consuming a character is the `.` expression, it matches any character and can only fail if we reached the end of input.

The remaining parsing expressions are combinators, they must be composed with sub-expressions. Identifiers and integers are sequences of one or more characters and we use the combinator `e+` to repeat `e` while it succeeds. For example `identifier` matches "x_1" from the input "x_1 x_2" by successively applying `["a-zA-Z0-9_"]` to the input, it parses `x`, `_` and `1` and then fails on the space character. It however succeeds, even if the match is partial, and `identifier` returns the remaining input " x_2" and the data read. A requirement of `e+` is that `e` must be repeated *at least once*. The `e*` expression does not impose this constraint and allow `e` to be repeated *zero or more times*. `e*` and `e+` will consume as much input as they can because they are *greedy* operators.

Before explaining the others combinators, we take a glimpse at the generated code and how to use it. Oak will generate two functions per rule, a *recognizer* and a *parser*. A recognizer only matches the input against a specific rule but does not build any value from it. A parser matches and builds the corresponding AST helped by user semantic actions. For example, the functions `parse_identifier` and `recognize_identifier` will be generated for rule `identifier`. The `#![show_api]` attribute tells Oak to output, as a compilation note, the signatures of all the generated functions. We obtain the following from the `Calc` grammar:

```rust
note: pub mod calc {
    pub fn parse_let_kw(input: &str, pos: usize)
     -> oak_runtime::ParseState<()>;
    pub fn recognize_let_kw(input: &str, pos: usize)
     -> oak_runtime::ParseState<()>;

    pub fn recognize_identifier(input: &str, pos: usize)
     -> oak_runtime::ParseState<()>;
    pub fn parse_identifier(input: &str, pos: usize)
     -> oak_runtime::ParseState<Vec<char>>;

    pub fn parse_integer(input: &str, pos: usize)
     -> oak_runtime::ParseState<Vec<char>>;
  // ...
  // Rest of the output truncated for the tutorial.
}
```

We can already use these functions in our main:

```
fn main() {
  let input = "let";
  assert!(calc::parse_let_kw(input, 0).into_result(input).is_ok());
}
```

The difference between `parse_*` and `recognize_*`

### Exercise

Extend the grammar to support `let-in` anywhere in expressions. Note that you do not need to modify the AST.
